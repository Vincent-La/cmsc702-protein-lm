(1) Average recall@L across each sequence in MSA: of the coupled DCA pairs how many of them are in the top-L esm predictions.
Coupled DCA pairs determined by some cutoff, we shoud look at the output distributions but can also do plots as we move the cutoff




(2) Precision@L b/w representative structure to generally compare how the methods actually are at contact prediction. 
Among the Top-L predictions from esm, dca how many are true contacts. 
We can actually vary L here to get a better feel of what proportion of DCA scores we can reasonably consider to be coupled 
n


We already have (2) directly compares ESM/DCA contact prediction with a "true" representative structure
-- use precision@L as a comparison per what other people report

The top c dca scores are actually coupled because they are actually in contact! We can consider these to be the relevant dca scores
For the top L ESM predictions, how many of the top c dca score are retrieved

intersect(topL esm contacts, top_c dca)/ c   <-- per sequence

For (1):


Recall@k = of all relevant instances how many are in the top k reccomendations
         = for all coupled dca pairs how many are contained in the top k ESM ranking for {esm_fold, contact_head}


as you increase K recall@k approaches 1, we can vary the k value for recall@k and compute averages over the msa



plmdca_scores <-- plmdca(MSA)
relevant 

mfdca_scores <-- mfdca(MSA)

for each seq in MSA:
    ESM_FOLD_predictions <-- esm_fold_inference(seq)
    ESM_CONTACT_HEAD predictions <-- esm_contact_head_inference(seq)

    recall@k_esmfold
